#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    Our group set out to create a fun, lighthearted app called WOOF OR WOOPS!!The WOOF OR WOOPS!! app helps you figure out if a growling dog might bite by asking five fun questions about its behavior.
    After you answer, it gives you a silly “Risk Score” to let you know if you’re in danger or just dealing with a friendly pup. It’s all for laughs and a bit of fun!
#THE PROBLEM(that does'nt exist)
    Imagine standing face-to-face with an unknown dog.
    In this tense moment, would you pull out your phone, launch an app, and answer five behavior-related questions to determine if the dog is likely to bite?
#THE SOLUTION(that nobody asked for)
    The WOOF OR WOOPS!! app turns that anxiety into laughs by helping you predict the dog’s behavior with silly questions. Is it a threat or just a woof in disguise?
